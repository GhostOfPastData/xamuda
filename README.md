# xamuda
An IVR system for Agricultural Extension for Farmers in Developing Countries

This code is based off the twilio welcome code for IVR system setup, what I did was to edit the code to customised it based on my need at the time I was working on setting up a system for xamuda. 

While I did not have a motive of committing more to this code right now, I may eventually find the time to commit to it later after I am done with this present project defense life cycle.
